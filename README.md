# Candy Box Mod

This mod was made for the [Candy Box Game](http://candies.aniwey.net/) to improve the user experience and make the game more fun.

This mod doesn't change the game system, so its not a kind of cheat.

## Features

- Top bar
- Improved save system
- Load system

## Installation

Drag the installation link to the bookmark bar of your navigator, open the [Candy Box page](http://candies.aniwey.net/) and click on the **Candy Box Mod** of your bookmark.

So the mod will be loaded in the game.

Installation link (to drag): [Candy Box Mod](javascript:%28function%28%29%7B%20var%20d%20%3D%20document%2Cs%20%3D%20d.createElement%28%27script%27%29%2Ct%20%3D%20d.body%20%7C%7C%20d.getElementsByTagName%28%27head%27%29%5B0%5D%20%7C%7C%20d.documentElement%3Bs.src%20%3D%20%27http%3A//localhost/candy-box-extension/script.js%27%3Bt.appendChild%28s%29%3B%7D%29%28%29%3B)

## Top Bar

A top bar will be created when the mod loads. This bar will contain information about your current candy stock and buttons to save and load your game.

## Improved save system

With the **Save Button** in the **Top Bar**, now you can save your game any time you want, without going to the **Candy Box Tab**

When you click in the save button, it will be green highlighted if the game saves sucessfully, and you will not see the annoying window telling you about *the code*. ;)

Your *save code* will be saved in a cookie in your browser and you will be able to load it after.

## Load system

With *your code* saved in a cookie, you can simply click in the **Load Button** and play your game.

## TODO

- Hotkeys for itens
- Settings
- Save on close
- Auto-save
- Profile system (slots for multiple saves)
